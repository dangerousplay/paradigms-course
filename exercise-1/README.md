In this assignment we should write two simple math programs in one language that we know and another one in one language that we don't know.
The program is a simple math expression parser and evaluator with support for the following operations:

- `*` - Multiply
- `/` - Divide
- `+` - Sum
- `-` - Subtract
- `^` - Pow

## Vlang

Compiling and running the program:

```shell
$ cd vlang
$ v run main.v
```

## nim

Compiling and running the program:

```shell
$ cd nim
$ nim r main.nim
```
